                    <p>Yongwoo Lee is a composer deeply interested in humanities and aesthetics. During his undergraduate studies, he majored in history and fusion culture content development while minoring in composition. Throughout his involvement as a researcher at the <a href="https://archive.knu.ac.kr">History and Culture Archive Center</a>, committee member as a representative of youth at Daegu City, cultural interpreter, Conscripted Firefighters Agent (CFA), and researcher at <a href="https://www.creamamusic.com">CREAMA</a> (Center for Research in Electro-Acoustic Music and Audio), he gained invaluable life experiences.</p>

                    <p>His artistic aim revolves around integrating various elements of humanities into music. For instance, his compositional methodologies include translating poetry into music based on Korean phonetics by mirroring it in tones or applying 20th-century music techniques sequentially in line with historical developments. Having completed his master's degree in composition, he recently delved into electronic music. His works and projects were selected and performed at HEATWAVE, DCMC 2019, ICMC 2023, 2024, 12th CUHK (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen) Salon Concert, FEST-M 2024 (KEAMS), and IRCAM Forum 2024.</p>

                Yongwoo Lee worked hard on music during his undergraduate studies in humanities, focusing on jazz, alternative R&B, and hip-hop, among other genres. He released a jazz trio album and composed numerous jazz and alternative songs. Additionally, he delved into music technology, which led him to explore mixing and mastering after participating in a mixing contest, and he mixed and mastered the KNU official cheer song. Furthermore, he composed music by combining historical content with modern styles and performed at the Namyangju Dasan Culture Festival. He also wrote the promotional anthem for the UNESCO Memory of the World promotion video at the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Hall.

                In his early 20s, he served as a Conscripted Firefighter Agent (CFA) at the Gyungsan Fire Station for two years, where he saved lives and prevented injuries from fires and accidents. The experiences of many people's lives and deaths had a significant impact on him. The experiences he gained as a team member at rescue operations and fire scenes became a turning point in his life, leading him to contemplate how he could live for society and people. Music became one of his breakthroughs, and the humanities, culture, and history that he majored in are directly connected to his life.

                  He delved into the classical music composition including works of many combinations (solo/duo/chamber) as well as using electronic materials. Specifically, he has tried to embody his unique background with studying humanitics and life experience that I had.
